## 100 lines rule

Bob Martin takes the idea that “if small is good, then smaller must be better” to an extreme in Clean Code:

> The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.

This can be fully applied to the components of the react.
